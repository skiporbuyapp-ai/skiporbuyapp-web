    "title": "Frequently asked",
    "titleAccent": "questions",
    "q1": "What is cost per use?",
    "a1": "Cost per use is a simple formula: the total price of an item divided by the number of times you use it. It tells you the real value of a purchase — a £200 jacket worn 200 times costs just £1 per use, while a £50 jacket worn 5 times costs £10 per use. Cost per use helps you see past the price tag.",
    "q2": "Is this a subscription?",
    "a2": "No. Skip Or Buy: Worth It? is a one-time purchase. You pay once (£4.99 / $4.99) and own it forever. There are no subscriptions, no ads, and no in-app purchases.",
    "q3": "What categories are included?",
    "a3": "The app includes 33 built-in categories covering everything from clothing and footwear to electronics, kitchen items, furniture, fitness gear, beauty products, and more. Each category comes with real-world benchmarks so you can see how your cost per use compares.",
    "q4": "Does the app need internet?",
    "a4": "No. The app works completely offline. All calculations happen on your device. You don't need an internet connection to use any feature.",
    "q5": "Is my data stored in the cloud?",
    "a5": "No. All your data — saved items, photos, calculations — is stored locally on your device. We don't have accounts, cloud storage, or any way to access your data. Your information stays on your phone."
